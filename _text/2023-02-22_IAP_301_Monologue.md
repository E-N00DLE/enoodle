Tired. So tired of the place I had been. It was all I could think
about every night on the way home. There was no way around it, but I
already knew that. Everyone has to go through some kind of grind, but
when you’ve been craving something different for years already
beforehand it seems futile in the first place.

Do we only feel different when our outlook changes? Is our outlook the
only thing we have to differentiate our time? It’s a strange shift, an
outlook. Can you feel it changing day by day? Or do years go by, only
to wake up the next day and be a completely different person.

It was summer then, and I had driven home from the spa I worked at
with the window down, letting cool dark air mix with the soft music I
played for quiet nights. Leaving the beach was my favorite,
approaching the bridge with its string of street lights guiding an
amber trail for you to cruise on and enjoy the dusky sky and water
flowing together. Dusk was my favorite time, maybe it still is.
Whenever the horizon is losing its luster and turning into a calm
blanket of navy, I feel like whatever I lost out on in the day is
done, and I’m given the gift of trying again in the relaxed hold of
silent hours. When I’m alone, and the pressure to get things done has
been lifted, I can breathe.

So I was alone that night. I got home and when I stepped in my
apartment, I could see it all. My flatscreen staring at me, nothing I
care to watch. My partner’s green velvet couch, looking for company
when I had none to offer. My cat, staring out the window
disinterestedly, mirroring my outlook. Nothing was here for me. It was
my place to live, but that was it. I walked onto the carpet and set my
things down on the coffee table. I sank to my knees and buried my head
on the couch. I wrapped my arms around my head and wracked my brain
trying to come up with a reason to stay here, to stay near my family,
to stay in my five year relationship, to do the same thing on the same
days and never look forward to the same things and go the same places
and feel the same things. And I just, couldn’t.

There was nothing else I could do.
I had to get out of the rut I had been in since who knows when.

When they got back, it was calm.
All I managed to say was, “I have to leave.”
They knew what I meant.

I wish moving on was easy to grasp, something anyone could do at the
drop of a hat.
