<h1>WE VOW TO EMBRACE:</h1>



<p>EXPERIMENTATION</p>

_(find what excites you, search for what-ifs)_

question the traditional

hold no convention as sacred

always consider inverse possibilities

seek fundamental characteristics of mediums



<p>LIMITATION</p>

_(stretch perceived boundaries, learn capabilities)_

create specific parameters

work towards defined processes

show that repetition legitimizes

pursue understanding of potentials



<p>IMPERFECTION</p>

_(embrace change, favor motion)_

discover quirks of every tool

contextualize error as intention

search for new qualities of texture

embrace acceptance as part of the process



<p>THE INTERDISCIPLINARY</p>

_(explore combinations, allow for flexibility)_

use tools as needed for execution

combine mediums based on curiosity

seek understanding interactions

substitute parts and pieces for inspiration



<p>CREDIT</p>

_(celebrate others, recognize merits)_

reference original sources

build upon each othersâ€™ ideas

create community through our work

collaborate across disciplines
