<h1>WE VOW TO EMBRACE:</h1>



****EXPERIMENTATION****

__(find what excites you, search for what-ifs)__

question the traditional

hold no convention as sacred

always consider inverse possibilities

seek fundamental characteristics of mediums



****LIMITATION****

__(stretch perceived boundaries, learn capabilities)__

create specific parameters

work towards defined processes

show that repetition legitimizes

pursue understanding of potentials



****IMPERFECTION****

__(embrace change, favor motion)__

discover quirks of every tool

contextualize error as intention

search for new qualities of texture

embrace acceptance as part of the process



****THE INTERDISCIPLINARY****

__(explore combinations, allow for flexibility)__

use tools as needed for execution

combine mediums based on curiosity

seek understanding interactions

substitute parts and pieces for inspiration



****CREDIT****

__(celebrate others, recognize merits)__

reference original sources

build upon each othersâ€™ ideas

create community through our work

collaborate across disciplines
