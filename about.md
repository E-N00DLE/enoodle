Evan Naud is an electronic musician and interdisciplinary artist based in Atlanta, GA. <a href="/pdf/EN_ASU_IAP_BA.pdf" target="_blank">As a top class graduate</a> of ASU's IAP program and an enthusiast of experimental creative interaction, their work under E Noodle is an exploration of hardware and software implementation. Originally realized by combining performances on bass guitar and programming synthesizers in digital audio workstations, any process involving digital signals and analog equipment is welcome.

Inspired by retro consoles and computing, the artist merges modern capability with qualities of years prior. Whether it's through bit-crushed audio, pixel-art resolutions, analog synth tapes, or live performance, E Noodle embraces combining approaches. Throughout this work, they aim to emphasize the human aspects within our ever-increasingly computerized world.â€‹
