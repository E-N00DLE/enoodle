Live performance electro-acoustic single 'Spiral_Staircase' presents chromatic jams with Elektron's FM groovebox alongside sample-chopped vocals on a PO-33 K.O! Bridged by sections of ripping lead sequences on Bass Station II, and transitioning into a trio of live drums, bass, and vocals, the accomponying music video places emphasis on the contrast between man and machine as they collaborate together.
